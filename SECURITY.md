# Security Policy

This project handles urban/suburban passenger transit dispatch
operations and safety-concern workflows. Treat vulnerabilities as
potentially high impact even when the demo data is synthetic --
this vertical has a direct passenger-safety dimension.

## Do Not Disclose Publicly

Report privately before opening public issues for:

- credential exposure
- real passenger, driver or vehicle data exposure
- authorization bypass
- UrbanTransitDispatchGovernor bypass
- audit-ledger tampering
- over-disclosure in safety-concern reports or exports
- tenant isolation failures

## Reporting

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when available for the repository.
If that is unavailable, contact the repository maintainers through the
cloud-itonami organization before publishing details.

Include:

- affected commit or version
- reproduction steps
- expected and actual behavior
- impact on passenger/driver/vehicle data, policy enforcement or audit logging
- suggested fix, if known

## Production Guidance

- Store secrets outside Git.
- Keep real passenger, driver and vehicle data outside this repository.
- Run policy tests before deployment.
- Export and review audit logs regularly.
- Use least privilege for operators and service accounts.
